#### Hi, I am Batuhan! 
#### I am a scientist-in-training, exploring brain mechanisms that allow us to adapt and learn.

I started my journey in neuroscience when I was an intern in a laboratory. Our limited knowledge in the working principles of the brain lead me to pursue a graduate degree in this field. I moved to Ankara do a masters degree in neuroscience at Bilkent University <a href="http://web2.bilkent.edu.tr/vision/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Vision Group</a>. I worked in a project to where we established a population receptive field protocol for retinotopic mapping of visual cortex of humans. Throughout this project, I gained substantial experience in data collection, optimized fRMI sequences, visual stimuli to generate visual cortex maps with highest quality. I also gained immense experience in computational models to analyse biological data.

Afterwards, I moved to the US to start a PhD in 2019. I am currently a PhD candiate in Neuroscience in Rutgers University in <a href="https://www.polacklab.org" target="_blank">Polack Lab</a>. Although delayed due to COVID in NJ, I got the opportunity to take part in a project explaining critical questions on how the brain changes during learning [(see Research)](/research).
