<p>I am Batuhan! I am a scientist-in-training, exploring mechanisms that allow us to learn in our brain!</p>

<p>I studied psychology and business during my Bachelors. For the duration of my undergraduate years I was initially interested in organizational psychology. Then, I met neuroscience as an intern in a laboratory and realized how much we still donâ€™t know about how our brain works! Thereafter, I moved to Ankara from my hometown to do my Masters degree. There, I worked on mapping human visual cortex using population receptive field models. In this project, I gained substantial experience in data collection for fMRI studies, from optimizing fRMI sequences to visual stimulus generation and optimization. I learned to use models to analyse fMRI data, and automatized the processing pipelines. I also got the chance to learn bioinformatics. I learned how to apply GLM models on microRNA and gene expression data through GEO utilizing R.</p>

<p>I moved to US start my PhD journey in 2019. I am currently a PhD candiate in Neuroscience in Rutgers University in <a href="https://www.polacklab.org" target="_blank">Polack Lab</a>. Although we were hit by COVID in March 2020, we managed to produce very exciting scientific articles explaining critical questions on how brain changes during learning <a href="/research">(see research section)</a>.</p>
