<p>These questions govern my research as a PhD student in neuroscience. I employ a variety of behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational techniques to try to answer these questions. I put a high level of emphasis on robust data analytics that allow us to study the working principles of a given brain system.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for summer internships and freelance projects to apply my computational skills with a critical perspective to solve problems in real-world scenarios.</p>
