<p>I am Batuhan! I am a scientist-in-training, exploring brain mechanisms that allow us to adapt and learn.</p>

<p>I started my journey in neuroscience when I was an intern in a laboratory. Our limited knowledge in the working principles governing the brain sparked my interest to pursue a graduate level degree in this field. Thereafter, I moved to Ankara do a masters degree in neuroscience at Bilkent University <a href="http://web2.bilkent.edu.tr/vision/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Vision Group</a>. I worked on mapping the human visual cortex with fMRI using population receptive field models. In this project, I gained substantial experience in data collection for fMRI studies, from optimizing fRMI sequences to visual stimulus generation and optimization. I learned to use models to analyse fMRI data, and automatized the processing pipelines. I also got the chance to learn bioinformatics. I learned how to apply GLM models on gene expression through GEO utilizing R.</p>

<p>After I got my masters degree, I moved to US start my PhD journey in 2019. I am currently a PhD candiate in Neuroscience in Rutgers University in <a href="https://www.polacklab.org" target="_blank">Polack Lab</a>. Although we were hit by COVID in March 2020, we managed to produce very exciting scientific articles explaining critical questions on how brain changes during learning <a href="/research">(see research section)</a>.</p>
