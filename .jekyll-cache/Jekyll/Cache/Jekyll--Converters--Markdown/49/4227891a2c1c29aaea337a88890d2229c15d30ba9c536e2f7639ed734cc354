<p>I started my journey in neuroscience when I was an intern in a laboratory. Our limited knowledge in the working principles governing the brain sparked my interest to pursue a graduate level degree in this field. Thereafter, I moved to Ankara do a masters degree in neuroscience at Bilkent University <a href="http://web2.bilkent.edu.tr/vision/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Vision Group</a>. I worked in a project to where we established a population receptive field protocol for retinotopic mapping of visual cortex of humans. Througout this project, I gained substantial experience in data collection, optimized fRMI sequences, visual stimuli to generate visual cortex maps with highest quality. I also gained immense experience in computational models to analyse biological data and automatized the data processing pipelines.</p>

<p>After I got my masters degree, I moved to US start my PhD journey in 2019. I am currently a PhD candiate in Neuroscience in Rutgers University in <a href="https://www.polacklab.org" target="_blank">Polack Lab</a>. Although we were hit by COVID in March 2020, we managed to produce very exciting scientific articles explaining critical questions on how brain changes during learning <a href="/research">(see Research)</a>.</p>
