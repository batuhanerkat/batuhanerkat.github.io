<font size="5"> How do we perceive the world around us? <br />
What are the computational principles that govern our perception? <br /> 
Which neuronal mechanisms that underlie perceptual changes? </font>

<p class="porthole" style="width:100%;height:100px;"> </p>

<p>These questions govern my PhD research. I employ a variety of behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational techniques to try to answer these questions. I put a high level of emphasis on robust data analytics that allow us to study the working principles of a given brain system.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for summer internships and freelance projects to apply my computational skills with a critical perspective to solve problems in real-world scenarios.</p>
