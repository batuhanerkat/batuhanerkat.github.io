These questions govern my PhD research. To answer these questions, I employ a variety of behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational techniques. I put a high level of emphasis on robust data analytics that allow us to study the working principles of a given brain system.

I am currently looking for summer internships and freelance projects to apply my computational skills with a critical perspective to solve problems in real-world scenarios.
